# Sync Privacy Preferences Policy Control and System Preferences

From macOS Mojave, Privacy Preferences Policy Control is introduced.
Privacy Preferences Policy Control allows us to enable/disable accessibility for each application.

When accessibility of an application is enabled, the checkbox in "System Preferences > Security and Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility" is not checked.
However, in fact the accessibility of the target application is certainly enabled.

To enable end users to recognize accessibility-enabled applications using Privacy Preferences Policy Control
we would like to check the GUI, but is there any better way?
The end user can check the privacy preferences policy control settings from "System Preferences > Profile", but using them is not practical.
