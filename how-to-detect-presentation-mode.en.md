# How to detect presentation mode

In an organization, the IT adminstrator may want to force software updates.
Depending on the contents of software update and application update, there are cases where it is necessary to restart the OS.

We often have a requirement to refrain from restarting, as it may affect the business during presentation in presentation mode (or during online MTG using a camera or microphone).
To do this, we need to use some means, preferably using the command line, to determine if the device is currently presenting (or on-line MTG using a camera or microphone).

How can we determine "presentation mode (or using a camera or microphone)"?
